# Goblin_Game

 GoblinGame is the simple application developed within pygame. This application is based on high-level programming language, Python. The reasons for using python are 
* Improved productivity
* Interpreted language
* Dynamically typed
* Free and open source
* Vast libraries support.

 GoblinGame uses SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) Library with allowing real-time developing environment. Random and Sprite are typical libraries used in this platform. This language structures the code to facilitate the frameworks. In other words, source code is classified with class and definition to let the code easily insert integer and character values. As python is known as productivity language, we decide to work codes as simple as possible. This game also executes the code line by line. GoblinGame loads mp3, JPEG, and Png files to generate the GUI(Graphical User interface). If the error happens, it stops further execution and reports back the error which has occurred. Developed in the IDE, visual studio code. It can be easily executed through Windows Powershell or should be work in a text editor limitedly.

## Prerequisites

* Python (3.8.2)
* Pygame (1.9.1)
* Visual Studio Code (Recommended but not obligatory)

## Installing

Step One : Clone the repo without checking out a work tree.
```
git clone -n <repo-url>
```
Step Two : check out the file.
```
git checkout master -- path/within/repo/to/file
```

## Running the tests

* Run intro.py to see the result of the man shooting bullets. Your score is on the top of the screen. You get score 1 by hitting goblin with bullets and subtract score 5 if you are hit by goblins.

## Break down into end to end tests

No Break down into end to end tests required.

## And coding style tests

No coding style tests required.

## Built With

* Python (3.8.2) : Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
* Pygame (1.9.1) : Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.
* Visual Studio Code : Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[6] It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is highly customizable, allowing users to change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality. The source code is free and open-source, released under the permissive MIT License.[7] The compiled binaries are freeware for any use.
